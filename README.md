# Infinite Resources

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It can be downloaded from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-infinite-resources).

## Description

Makes all resources infinite and not deplete, so their yield will never change. If a resource is not normally infinite, this mod will make it infinite and have 100% yield. Resources that are already infinite (like oil or some added by other mods) and have other yield settings are unchanged (except for making it so they don't deplete), so they may spawn with yields above or below 100%. But once spawned, no resource should deplete from mining. Also, whenever a resource is spawned, its yield is set to exactly its normal amount (for previously non-infinite resources, this is 100%), regardless of what yield it was given when the ore patch was generated.

I made this because other mods didn't quite do what I wanted:
- [Endless resources with full yield](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/EndlessResources) modifies oil-like resources in weird ways.
- [Infinite Resources - Depletion](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/infinite-resources-depletion) still lets resources deplete to very low yields.
-  [Infinite Resources](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/inf_res) only supports vanilla ores.
-  [Angel's Infinite Ores](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/angelsinfiniteores) creates entirely different ore patches with a somewhat cool but ultimately distracting and annoying shine effect. I wanted my mod to not affect map generation and be able to be applied to existing maps and/or removable without corrupting a map.
